# üåå 3D Solar System Simulation

An interactive and visually stunning 3D Solar System built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It simulates planets orbiting the sun with controls for speed, pause, and theme toggling. Includes interactive camera targeting and hover labels for each planet.

## üöÄ Features

- Realistic planet orbit simulation
- Adjustable orbital speed per planet
- Click-to-focus camera on any planet
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Pause/resume simulation
- Hover to display planet names

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## üì¶ Installation & Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- A simple HTTP server to avoid CORS issues

### Option 1: Open Directly (Quick Demo)
